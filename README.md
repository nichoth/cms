[pure component](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent)
> React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesn’t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison

[memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo)
> React.memo is a higher order component. It’s similar to React.PureComponent but for function components instead of classes.

> If your function component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result.

## [https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html](hooks)

> Hooks don’t work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes.

[effect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#effect-hook)
> When you call useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM
